## Summary of `r as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), '%Y'))-1` Willamette River spring Chinook return

### Subsection Test

The total Willamette River spring Chinook return to the Columbia River mouth during `r as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), '%Y'))-1` is estimated to be `r willChsRet.dat[nrow(willChsRet.dat)-1,3]` fish (Table 1).  An estimated 10,728 of these fish were unmarked (~19%).  The 2022 total reconstructed return was approximately 108% of forecast.  The Clackamas River component was approximately 151% of forecast, with 6,432 spring Chinook returning to the Clackamas River compared to 4,247 (95% credible interval: 2,479â€“7,291) fish expected.

The total return of adipose-fin-marked hatchery fish to the Columbia River mouth in 2022 is estimated to be 46,589, compared to 39,090 fish expected.  Counts at the Willamette Falls fishway indicate that 31,937 fin-marked hatchery fish and 6,692 unmarked fish passed the fish ladder.  The full reconstruction of the 2022 return is shown in Table 2.
