## Summary of 2022 Willamette River spring Chinook return

### Subsection Test

The total Willamette River spring Chinook return to the Columbia River mouth during 2022 is estimated to be 1926 fish (Table 1).  An estimated 10,728 of these fish were unmarked (~19%).  The 2022 total reconstructed return was approximately 108% of forecast.  The Clackamas River component was approximately 151% of forecast, with 6,432 spring Chinook returning to the Clackamas River compared to 4,247 (95% credible interval: 2,479â€“7,291) fish expected.

The total return of adipose-fin-marked hatchery fish to the Columbia River mouth in 2022 is estimated to be 46,589, compared to 39,090 fish expected.  Counts at the Willamette Falls fishway indicate that 31,937 fin-marked hatchery fish and 6,692 unmarked fish passed the fish ladder.  The full reconstruction of the 2022 return is shown in Table 2.
